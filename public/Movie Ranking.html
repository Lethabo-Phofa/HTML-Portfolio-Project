<h1>Lethabo's Top 10 favourite movies </h1>
<h2>My favourite movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Deadpool</h3>

<p> 
    This one is too funny. It made my stomach hurt as I could not digest the amounts of dark humour. Laughing emoji
</p>

<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>

<p>
    I liked the angle that the Coen brothers went with. Lleweyln was set up to be the guy but got taken out by the cartel.
    Anton Sugar ticked all the right boxes for me. 
</p>

<h3>Black Panther</h3>

<p>
    Probably obvious but I get to explore a world of what could've been or what should've been. The casting was pretty great and I feel like though it was 
    conceptulised by Americans it really paints Africa in a positve light with great respect to tradition and culture.

</p>

<h3>Limitless</h3>

<p>
The guy ate a pill that changed his life basically reminds me of Sneako's streams where he talks about how people are being brainwashed and get satisified with whatever they fed.
Also made me see how powerful the mind can be if you really put it to work. Your lifestyle can be determined by your mindset.  
</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>

<p>
 I see the vision of this film, it made me travel back in time but still kept me rooted in the modern age. Just comes to that social injustice and racism are ever so prevelent. 
 That girl was pretty crazy too, in fact her whole family. Imagine holding a stronger grudge on Jesse Owens than Hitler. Yikes.   
</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>
    I can't really say much cause I'd be breaking the first rule. 
</p>

<h3>Now You See Me</h3>

<p>
    Who doesn't love a movie about magic and illusions. Fair play to Mark Ruffalo his plot was actually dope when I watched this for the first time.
</p>

<h3>Rocky IV</h3>

<p>
    I got the eye of the tiger. Now with the formation of Creed, this movie has to be up there cause its events literally set the foundation for the next gen movies.
    The plot itself wasn't bad actually. There was an overall theme of Russia vs the US. 
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<p>
    Who doesn't love a lil bit of the Joker. The film was pretty gritty and the cinematography was good.
</p>

<h3> John Wick: Chapter 1</h3>

<p>
    Baba Yaga. The man, the myth, the legend.
